# Why should I learn Python?

---

Python is easy to read, easy to learn.

It's versatilie and simple.

You can create complex applications with a small amount of code

Note:
- It's incredibly powerful and versatile
- It's easy to read and understand
- There's not too many layers to it
	- You don't have to manually manage memeory
- It's commonly used
	- Currently the most popular programming language
	- It's used across the board
---

By the end of this session, you won't know everything

However, you'll have a decent head start at learning to code

Note:
- We're going to talk for the next 30-50 minutes
- then we're going to set you off onto a project in order to learn python
---

But what can you do in python

# Fundamentals

- Variables
- Data Types
- Operations
- If Statements
- Loops
- Functions

Note:
Unspoken Rules
- Program flow goes from top to bottom
- Spacing is fine
---
## Variables

```python
pi = 3.14
print(pi)
> 3.14
```


Note:
- Variables are the bread and butter of programming
- One of the key fundamentals
- Variables act as a substitution
---
Variables work like a lookup table

```python
one = 1
print(one)
> 1
```

| Name | Value |
| -: | :-: |
| one | 1 |


---
They can also be reassigned
```python
number = 1
print(number)
> 1
number = 2
print(number)
> 2
```
---
```python
is_logged_in = False

if is_logged_in:
    message = "Welcome"
else:
	message = "Your not logged in"
```
Note:
- On it's own, this isn't very useful
- However, combined with ability to change code paths later makes it more important
---
Variable names are made up of letters, numbers, and underscores

All variables have to start with a letter or underscore
```python
point = "Correct"
point_1 = "Yes"
_point = "Valid"
1_point = "Invalid"
# SyntaxError
+_symbol = "+"
# SyntaxError
```

---
## Data Types

---

Every value has a type like `str`, `float`, `int`

It describes what type of data the value is

---

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Boolean |`bool` | True or False |
| Integer |`int` | Whole Number |
| Floating Point | `float` | Decimal Number |
| String |`str` | Text |
| List | `list` | List of values |
| Dictionary | `dict` | Table of keys and values |
| None |`None` | An empty value |


---
## Literals

```python
boolean = True
number = 1
decimal = 1.5
text = ""
numbers_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
table = {
	1: "one",
	2: "two",
}
```

Note:
- This is an example of how to create them as what are called literals
- Literals means they're placed inside the code directly
- Rather than being created whilst the program is running
---
## Boolean

```python
is_water_wet = False
is_gravity_real = True
```
Note:
- Simpleist to understand
- Yes or No
- Talk about the capital letters
---
## Int

```python
answer_to_everything = 42
speed_of_light = 299_792_458
negative_one = -1
```

Note:
- Can also hold
---
## Float


```python
pi = 3.14
one = float(1)
```

---
Keep in mind, floats are inprecise. Don't use direct comparsion

```python
> 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2
0.6000000000000001
```

---
## String

```python
username = "ben"
dr_seuss = "Do you like green eggs and ham?"
```

Note:
- You can create a string by wrapping a piece of text in quotes
- Normal strings cannot go over multiple lines

---

You can make multi-line strings by using `"""` instead
```python
PARAGRAPH = """
This is a big long paragraph,
that goes over multiple lines
:)
"""
```

Note:
- If you need to create a big string, you can use a multi line string

---
### f-strings
Putting f in front of a string allows you to place variables inside
```python
username = "Ben Brady"
print(f"Hello {username}")
> Hello Ben Brady
```

---
## List

A list is known a collection type, it hold other values
```python
prime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
random_junk = [1, "a", 1.0, []]
matrix = [
	[1, 2, 3],
	[4, 5, 6],
	[7, 8, 9],
]
```

Note:
- It's the first mutable type
	- This means you can update it without reassigning it

---

List values can be accessed by indexing them

Watch out, lists indexes start at zero
```python
prime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
third_prime = prime_numbers[2]
# 3rd prime number, not second
```

---
Your also allowed to update items
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers[1] = 3
print(numbers)
> [1, 3, 2]
```

However, you can't add new values this way
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers[3] = 3
# IndexError: list assignment index out of range
```

---
Instead, you have to use append

```python
fruits = []
fruits.append("apple")
fruits.append("pear")
print(fruits)
> ["apple", "pear"]

fruits.append("strawberry")
print(fruits)
> ["apple", "pear", "strawberry"]
```

Note:
- This is the first method you'll see
- Most types have methods
	- They're unique per datatype
- They're the same as a function, accept they

---
## Dictionary

Store a variable to table

```python
table = {}
table["key"] = "value"
print(table)
> {'key': 'value'}
```

Note:
- A dict
- A key can be

---

A key has to be hashable / unchangeable

```python
table = {}
table[1] = "one"
table[{}] = "dict"
# TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'
```

Note:
- If you try to set a key a value

---

If you need to use multiple values, you can use a tuple

A tuple is like a list, but you can't change it

```python
table[(0, 1)] = {}
```

---
## None

```python
value = None
```

---
## Conversions
Some datatypes allows to convert to them

```python
str(1)
> "1"
int("1")
> 1
float("3.14")
> 3.14
list("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")
> ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', ...]
```

---

However, this isn't guaranteed

```python
int("one") # ValueError
int("3.14") # ValueError
list(1) # TypeError
```

```python
# However, str will alway succeed
# It'll provide a representation of the object
str({}) # Success
> "{}"
str(list)
> "<class 'list'>"
```

Note:
- Converting to str is always guareteed

---

## Math Symbols

| Name     | Operator | Equivelent    |
| -------- | -------- | ------------- |
| Plus     | `+`      | 1 + 2         |
| Minus    | `-`      | 1 - 2         |
| Divide   | `/`      | 1 รท 2         |
| Multiply | `*`      | 1 x 2         |
| Exponent | `**`     | 1<sup>2</sup> |

Note:
- Since รท was hard to reach on they keyboard, languages use / as divide
- Also since x is a letter, we use \* instead
- If you've ever used excel, it uses the same symbols

---

```python
2 * 3 + 4
>>> 9
2 * (3 + 4)
>>> 14

radius = 3
pi = 3.14
area = pi * (radius ** 2)
```

Note:
- Also BIDMAS order of operations from maths also applies
---

| Operator | Name                   |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
| ==       | Equals                 |
| !=       | Not Equals             |
| <        | Less Than              |
| <=       | Less Than or Equals    |
| >        | Greater Than           |
| >=       | Greater Than or Equals |

```python
1 == 1
>>> True
5 > 10
>>> False
```

---
Watch out for `==`

Since `=` is used for assigning variables

```python
a = 1
a == 1
> True
```

Note:
- Since `=` is used for creating variables
---
## If Statements

Note:
If statements allow you to do more complex logic

---
```python
area = 4
if area < 1:
    print("Area is less than 1")
```
The code runs `area < 1`
```python
area = 4
if False:
    print("Area is less than 1")
```

Note:
- If statements allows you to optionally run code based on some condition

---

If statements use indents to decide what inside it
```python
if True:
    print("This is run in the if statement")
    print("So is this")
    if True:
	    print("This is another block")


print("This is outside the block")
```

---

You can also use `else` to run something if it's not true
```python
a = 1
if a < 0:
    print("a is less than 1")
else:
	print("a is bigger than 1")
```

---


```python
a = 1
if a == 1:
	print("A is 1")
elif a < 10:
    print("A is less than 10")
else:
	print("A is bigger than 10")
```
Note:
You can also run code

---

You can use `and` to require two condition to be true

You can use `or` to require either conditions to be true
```python
student = True
healthy = True

if student and healthy:
    print("You're a healthy student")
elif student or healthy:
    print("You're either healthy or a student")
else:
	print("You're not healthy or a student")
```

---
## For Loops

```python
for x in range(3):
    print(x)

> 0
> 1
> 2
```

---

Range is just a shorthand for creating a list

Watch out range starts at 0

```python
list(range(3)) == [0, 1, 2]
```

---

It's quite common to iterate over lists

```python
fruits = ["apple", "pear", "orange"]
fruit_count = len(fruits)
for x in range(fruit_count):
    fruit = fruits[x]
    print(fruit)

> "apple"
> "pear"
> "orange"
```

Note:

---
For iterates over lists
```python
fruits = ["apple", "pear", "orange"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

> "apple"
> "pear"
> "orange"
```


---
## While Loops

```python
logging_in = True
while logging_in:
    print("Please log in")

    username = input("Username: ")
	if username == "ben":
		logging_in = False

```
---

Loop Forever

```python
while True:
    print("the end is never ")
```

---
### Loop Control

---
You can use `continue` to repeat a loop

```python
for x in range(10):
    is_even = x % 2 == 0
    if is_even:
	    continue

	print("Odd", x)
```

```python
while True:
    user_input = input("Type the letter '1'")
    if user_input != "1":
	    continue

	print("user typed the letter '1'")
```

---
You can use `break` to exit a loop early

```python
fruits = ["apple", "bannana", "cashew"]
for fruit in fruits:
	first_letter = fruit[0]
	if first_letter == "a":
		print(fruit, "begins with 'a'")
		break

> apple begins with 'a'
```

```python
while True:
    user_input = input("Type q to exit")
    if user_input == "q":
        break
```

---
## Input & Output

---

Print out values using print
```python
print(1)
>>> 1
```

You can also print out multiple values
```python
a = 1
b = 2
print(a, b)
```

---

Take user input using input
```python
name = input("Enter Your Name:")
print(name)

>>> "Ben"
```

---
## Functions

Note:
- In your code your going to have a lot repeating blocks
-

---
```python
print("Hi there! :)")
```

runs the same as

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hi there! :)")

say_hello()
> "Hi There"
```

Note:
This allows you to group blocks of code together
On it's own this isn't very useful, however... NEXT SLIDE

---
You also pass variables into a function

These are called parameters or arguments

```python
def say_hello(name):
    print("Hi there, ", name)

say_hello("Ben")
say_hello("Holly")
> "Hi there, Ben"
> "Hi there, Holly"
```

```python
name = "Ben"
print("Hi there, ", name)
name = "Holly"
print("Hi there, ", name)
```

---
### Parameters

```python
def print_parameters(a, b):
    print(f"a: {a}")
    print(f"b: {b}")


print_parameters(1, "foo")
> a: 1
> b: foo
```


---

You can also return values back from a function

```python
def calculate_rectangle_area(width, height):
    return width * height

def calculate_circle_area(radius):
	PI = 3.14
	return PI * (radius ** 2)


area = calculate_rectangle_area(5, 5)
print(area)
> 25
area = calculate_circle_area(5)
print(area)
> 78.5
```

---
You can also return nothing

This is useful for exiting a function early

```python
logged_in = False
def show_account_info():
    if not logged_In:
        return

	print("Secret account info")
```

---
### Function Tidbits

These aren't necessary or required ton know

But they're useful to know

Note:

---
### Keyword Arguments

```python
def calculate_area(width, height):
    return width * height

calculate_area(20, 10)
# is the same as
calculate_area(width=20, height=10)
# or even
calculate_area(
	height=10,
	width=20
)
```

Note:
- You can manual specify the parameters by name
- This means you can change the order

---
### Type Hints

```python
def calculate_area(width: int, height: int) -> int:
    return width * height

calculate_area(4, 4)
> 16
```

Type hints allow your IDE to warn you if your using the function wrong

Note:
- Type hints allow you indicate what types you want your parameters to be
- In this example, they hint that the LASER POINTER
	- width and height should be ints
	- returns an int

---
# General Advice

---
## File Handling

```python
f = open("input.txt")
text = f.read()

print(text)
> "This is the contents of input.txt"

# Make sure your close a file or bad things happen
f.close()
```

---
Instead use a `with` statement

This automatically closes the file when you exit the statement, even if it errors

```python
with open("input.txt") as f:
    text = f.read()

print(text)
> "This is the contents of input.txt"
```

---

You can write to files by opening them in write mode

```python
# "w" specified the filemode, "w" means write
with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello!")
```

---
## Errors

Sometimes functions can raise errors or exceptions

```python
with open("file.txt") as f:
	text = f.read()
# FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory
```

---
You can also raise errors like this
```python
raise ValueError("Invalid Value")
```

---
You can catch errors using try, except
```python
try:
	with open("file.txt") as f:
		text = f.read()
	print(text)
except FileNotFoundError:
	print("File does not exist")
```

Note:

---
You can also catch mutliple errors
```python
try:
	with open("file.txt") as f:
		text = f.read()
	print(text)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File does not exist")
except IsADirectoryError:
    print("File is a folder")
```

or group errors like this

```python
try:
	with open("file.txt") as f:
		text = f.read()
	print(text)
except (FileNotFoundError, IsADirectoryError):
	print("File is invalid")
```

---
You can also catch all errors by not specifying an error
```python
try:
    raise
except:
	pass
```

---
## Imports

Note:
- Being able to import other files and packages is extremely important when working on any project

---

```python
# square.py
def calculate_area(width: int, height: int) -> int:
	return width * height

def calculate_perimeter(width: int, height: int) -> int:
	return (width * 2) + (height * 2)
```

Note:
- Say we find our main file has gotten too big
- We can take some of the functions and drag them into their own file
---

```python
# app.py
import square

square.calculate_area(width=6, height=4)
> 8
```

Note:
- We can then import it into another file through an import
- The import name is the name of the file
---

```python
from square import calculate_area

calculate_area(width=6, height=4)
> 24
```

Note:
- We can also import individual variables by using a from import

---

```python
# modules/square.py
def calculate_area(width: int, height: int) -> int:
	return width * height
```

```python
# app.py
from modules import square
# or
from modules.square import calculate_area
```

Every value has a type like `str`, `float`, `int`

It describes what type of data the value is

| - | - | - |
| Boolean |`bool` | True or False |
| Integer |`int` | Whole Number |
| Floating Point | `float` | Decimal Number |

decimal = 1.5
text = ""
numbers_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
table = {
	1: "one",
	2: "two",
}
```

Note:
- This is an example of how to create them as what are called literals
- Literals means they're placed inside the code directly
- Rather than being created whilst the program is running
---
## Boolean

```python
is_water_wet = False
is_gravity_real = True
```
Note:
- Simpleist to understand
- Yes or No
- Talk about the capital letters
---
## Int

```python
answer_to_everything = 42
speed_of_light = 299_792_458
negative_one = -1
```

Note:
- Can also hold
---
## Float


```python
pi = 3.14
one = float(1)
```

---
Keep in mind, floats are inprecise. Don't use direct comparsion

```python
> 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2
0.6000000000000001
```

---
## String

```python
username = "ben"
dr_seuss = "Do you like green eggs and ham?"
```

Note:
- You can create a string by wrapping a piece of text in quotes
- Normal strings cannot go over multiple lines

---

You can make multi-line strings by using `"""` instead
```python
PARAGRAPH = """
This is a big long paragraph,
that goes over multiple lines
:)
"""
```

Note:
- If you need to create a big string, you can use a multi line string

---
### f-strings
Putting f in front of a string allows you to place variables inside
```python
username = "Ben Brady"
print(f"Hello {username}")
> Hello Ben Brady
```

---
## List

A list is known a collection type, it hold other values
```python
prime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
random_junk = [1, "a", 1.0, []]
matrix = [
	[1, 2, 3],
	[4, 5, 6],
	[7, 8, 9],
]
```

Note:
- It's the first mutable type
	- This means you can update it without reassigning it

---

List values can be accessed by indexing them

Watch out, lists indexes start at zero
```python
prime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
third_prime = prime_numbers[2]
# 3rd prime number, not second
```

---
Your also allowed to update items
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers[1] = 3
print(numbers)
> [1, 3, 2]
```

However, you can't add new values this way
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers[3] = 3
# IndexError: list assignment index out of range
```

---
Instead, you have to use append

```python
fruits = []
fruits.append("apple")
fruits.append("pear")
print(fruits)
> ["apple", "pear"]

fruits.append("strawberry")
print(fruits)
> ["apple", "pear", "strawberry"]
```

Note:
- This is the first method you'll see
- Most types have methods
	- They're unique per datatype
- They're the same as a function, accept they

---
## Dictionary

Store a variable to table

```python
table = {}
table["key"] = "value"
print(table)
> {'key': 'value'}
```

Note:
- A dict
- A key can be

---

A key has to be hashable / unchangeable

```python
table = {}
table[1] = "one"
table[{}] = "dict"
# TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'
```

Note:
- If you try to set a key a value

---

If you need to use multiple values, you can use a tuple

A tuple is like a list, but you can't change it

```python
table[(0, 1)] = {}
```

---
## None

```python
value = None
```

---
## Conversions
Some datatypes allows to convert to them

```python
str(1)
> "1"
int("1")
> 1
float("3.14")
> 3.14
list("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")
> ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', ...]
```

---

However, this isn't guaranteed

```python
int("one") # ValueError
int("3.14") # ValueError
list(1) # TypeError
```

```python
# However, str will alway succeed
# It'll provide a representation of the object
str({}) # Success
> "{}"
str(list)
> "<class 'list'>"
```

Note:
- Converting to str is always guareteed

---

## Math Symbols

| Name     | Operator | Equivelent    |
| -------- | -------- | ------------- |
| Plus     | `+`      | 1 + 2         |
| Minus    | `-`      | 1 - 2         |
| Divide   | `/`      | 1 รท 2         |
| Multiply | `*`      | 1 x 2         |
| Exponent | `**`     | 1<sup>2</sup> |

Note:
- Since รท was hard to reach on they keyboard, languages use / as divide
- Also since x is a letter, we use \* instead
- If you've ever used excel, it uses the same symbols

---

```python
2 * 3 + 4
>>> 9
2 * (3 + 4)
>>> 14

radius = 3
pi = 3.14
area = pi * (radius ** 2)
```

Note:
- Also BIDMAS order of operations from maths also applies
---

| Operator | Name                   |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
| ==       | Equals                 |
| !=       | Not Equals             |
| <        | Less Than              |
| <=       | Less Than or Equals    |
| >        | Greater Than           |
| >=       | Greater Than or Equals |

```python
1 == 1
>>> True
5 > 10
>>> False
```

---
Watch out for `==`

Since `=` is used for assigning variables

```python
a = 1
a == 1
> True
```

Note:
- Since `=` is used for creating variables
---
## If Statements

Note:
If statements allow you to do more complex logic

---
```python
area = 4
if area < 1:
    print("Area is less than 1")
```
The code runs `area < 1`
```python
area = 4
if False:
    print("Area is less than 1")
```

Note:
- If statements allows you to optionally run code based on some condition

---

If statements use indents to decide what inside it
```python
if True:
    print("This is run in the if statement")
    print("So is this")
    if True:
	    print("This is another block")


print("This is outside the block")
```

---

You can also use `else` to run something if it's not true
```python
a = 1
if a < 0:
    print("a is less than 1")
else:
	print("a is bigger than 1")
```

---


```python
a = 1
if a == 1:
	print("A is 1")
elif a < 10:
    print("A is less than 10")
else:
	print("A is bigger than 10")
```
Note:
You can also run code

---

You can use `and` to require two condition to be true

You can use `or` to require either conditions to be true
```python
student = True
healthy = True

if student and healthy:
    print("You're a healthy student")
elif student or healthy:
    print("You're either healthy or a student")
else:
	print("You're not healthy or a student")
```

---
## For Loops

```python
for x in range(3):
    print(x)

> 0
> 1
> 2
```

---

Range is just a shorthand for creating a list

Watch out range starts at 0

```python
list(range(3)) == [0, 1, 2]
```

---

It's quite common to iterate over lists

```python
fruits = ["apple", "pear", "orange"]
fruit_count = len(fruits)
for x in range(fruit_count):
    fruit = fruits[x]
    print(fruit)

> "apple"
> "pear"
> "orange"
```

Note:

---
For iterates over lists
```python
fruits = ["apple", "pear", "orange"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

> "apple"
> "pear"
> "orange"
```


---
## While Loops

```python
logging_in = True
while logging_in:
    print("Please log in")

    username = input("Username: ")
	if username == "ben":
		logging_in = False

```
---

Loop Forever

```python
while True:
    print("the end is never ")
```

---
### Loop Control

---
You can use `continue` to repeat a loop

```python
for x in range(10):
    is_even = x % 2 == 0
    if is_even:
	    continue

	print("Odd", x)
```

```python
while True:
    user_input = input("Type the letter '1'")
    if user_input != "1":
	    continue

	print("user typed the letter '1'")
```

---
You can use `break` to exit a loop early

```python
fruits = ["apple", "bannana", "cashew"]
for fruit in fruits:
	first_letter = fruit[0]
	if first_letter == "a":
		print(fruit, "begins with 'a'")
		break

> apple begins with 'a'
```

```python
while True:
    user_input = input("Type q to exit")
    if user_input == "q":
        break
```

---
## Input & Output

---

Print out values using print
```python
print(1)
>>> 1
```

You can also print out multiple values
```python
a = 1
b = 2
print(a, b)
```

---

Take user input using input
```python
name = input("Enter Your Name:")
print(name)

>>> "Ben"
```

---
## Functions

Note:
- In your code your going to have a lot repeating blocks
-

---
```python
print("Hi there! :)")
```

runs the same as

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hi there! :)")

say_hello()
> "Hi There"
```

Note:
This allows you to group blocks of code together
On it's own this isn't very useful, however... NEXT SLIDE

---
You also pass variables into a function

These are called parameters or arguments

```python
def say_hello(name):
    print("Hi there, ", name)

say_hello("Ben")
say_hello("Holly")
> "Hi there, Ben"
> "Hi there, Holly"
```

```python
name = "Ben"
print("Hi there, ", name)
name = "Holly"
print("Hi there, ", name)
```

---
### Parameters

```python
def print_parameters(a, b):
    print(f"a: {a}")
    print(f"b: {b}")


print_parameters(1, "foo")
> a: 1
> b: foo
```


---

You can also return values back from a function

```python
def calculate_rectangle_area(width, height):
    return width * height

def calculate_circle_area(radius):
	PI = 3.14
	return PI * (radius ** 2)


area = calculate_rectangle_area(5, 5)
print(area)
> 25
area = calculate_circle_area(5)
print(area)
> 78.5
```

---
You can also return nothing

This is useful for exiting a function early

```python
logged_in = False
def show_account_info():
    if not logged_In:
        return

	print("Secret account info")
```

---
### Function Tidbits

These aren't necessary or required ton know

But they're useful to know

Note:

---
### Keyword Arguments

```python
def calculate_area(width, height):
    return width * height

calculate_area(20, 10)
# is the same as
calculate_area(width=20, height=10)
# or even
calculate_area(
	height=10,
	width=20
)
```

Note:
- You can manual specify the parameters by name
- This means you can change the order

---
### Type Hints

```python
def calculate_area(width: int, height: int) -> int:
    return width * height

calculate_area(4, 4)
> 16
```

Type hints allow your IDE to warn you if your using the function wrong

Note:
- Type hints allow you indicate what types you want your parameters to be
- In this example, they hint that the LASER POINTER
	- width and height should be ints
	- returns an int

---
# General Advice

---
## File Handling

```python
f = open("input.txt")
text = f.read()

print(text)
> "This is the contents of input.txt"

# Make sure your close a file or bad things happen
f.close()
```

---
Instead use a `with` statement

This automatically closes the file when you exit the statement, even if it errors

```python
with open("input.txt") as f:
    text = f.read()

print(text)
> "This is the contents of input.txt"
```

---

You can write to files by opening them in write mode

```python
# "w" specified the filemode, "w" means write
with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello!")
```

---
## Errors

Sometimes functions can raise errors or exceptions

```python
with open("file.txt") as f:
	text = f.read()
# FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory
```

---
You can also raise errors like this
```python
raise ValueError("Invalid Value")
```

---
You can catch errors using try, except
```python
try:
	with open("file.txt") as f:
		text = f.read()
	print(text)
except FileNotFoundError:
	print("File does not exist")
```

Note:

---
You can also catch mutliple errors
```python
try:
	with open("file.txt") as f:
		text = f.read()
	print(text)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File does not exist")
except IsADirectoryError:
    print("File is a folder")
```

or group errors like this

```python
try:
	with open("file.txt") as f:
		text = f.read()
	print(text)
except (FileNotFoundError, IsADirectoryError):
	print("File is invalid")
```

---
You can also catch all errors by not specifying an error
```python
try:
    raise
except:
	pass
```

---
## Imports

Note:
- Being able to import other files and packages is extremely important when working on any project

---

```python
# square.py
def calculate_area(width: int, height: int) -> int:
	return width * height

def calculate_perimeter(width: int, height: int) -> int:
	return (width * 2) + (height * 2)
```

Note:
- Say we find our main file has gotten too big
- We can take some of the functions and drag them into their own file
---

```python
# app.py
import square

square.calculate_area(width=6, height=4)
> 8
```

Note:
- We can then import it into another file through an import
- The import name is the name of the file
---

```python
from square import calculate_area

calculate_area(width=6, height=4)
> 24
```

Note:
- We can also import individual variables by using a from import

---

```python
# modules/square.py
def calculate_area(width: int, height: int) -> int:
	return width * height
```

```python
# app.py
from modules import square
# or
from modules.square import calculate_area
```

## The best ways to learn

---
The best way to learn is by making something

---

If you have a problem, look it up.

StackOverflow usually gives good answers

---
Use tutorial websites

W3Schools is really good

---
If you want to do some practice

Try some online coding questions like leetcode
